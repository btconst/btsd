Currently, the amount of water for washing socks required 10 water. This is the same amount of water to wash a jacket. 
Besides, if very little blood splashes on your clothes, you need 10 water to wash it. I feels weird when I do wash clothes. and this is very annoying if you have hemophobic.
so the amount of water required for washing should be the sum of the amount of blood and dirt on the clothes.

- Before : any clothes require 10 amount of waters for washing.
- After : different conditions of clothes use different amounts of water for washing.

this mod will require 1 water to wash socks, but a jacket with a very large amount of blood may require more than 10 water.
